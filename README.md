# aws-api-lambda-starter-template
## Author: Eddie Hernandez
This is an AWS starter template using Serverless Framework that I created for testing purposes.

It uses an API Gateway and Lambda function with a sample GET /greetings endpoint that returns a "Hello World" message, and the event and context objects.

Serverless commands to run and deploy can be found in the package.json.  Including the ability to run everything offline.
